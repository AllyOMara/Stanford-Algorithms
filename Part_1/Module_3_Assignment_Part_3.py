TASK

This file (QuickSort.txt) contains all of the integers between
1 and 10,000 (inclusive, with no repeats) in unsorted order.
The integer in the ith row of the file gives you the ith entry
of an input array.
Compute the total number of comparisons used to sort the given
input file by QuickSort. As you know, the number of comparisons
depends on which elements are chosen as pivots, so we'll ask
you to explore three different pivoting rules

Compute the number of comparisons (as in Problem 1), using the
"median-of-three" pivot rule. I.e. Choose the pivot as follows.
Consider the first, middle, and final elements of the given array.
Identify which of these three elements is the median, and use this
as your pivot.
